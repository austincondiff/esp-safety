        In our previous projects we worked extensively with the ESP Safety
        line of Flame and Gas detectors, and had nothing but good experiences.
        We have determined that the ESP’s flame detectors significantly
        outshines the others.

    - quote: "Because of recent issues with the alignment and alarms of a different vendor’s gas detector I had to research alternatives to our problem. My first call was to ESP Safety. Within a few days ESP employees appeared at our site and installed the open path gas detector in one of our most difficult locations. Since the installation this detection equipment has worked great."
