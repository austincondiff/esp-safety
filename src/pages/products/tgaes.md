summary: >-
  The Model TGAES hydrocarbon gas detector is an open path gas detection system
  that provides continuous monitoring of combustible hydrocarbon gas
  concentrations in the range of 0 to 5 LEL/m, over a distance of 15 to 650 feet
  (5 to 200 meters). Standard system outputs include 4-20mA, HART and RS-485
  Modbus RTU serial communication.
model: TGAES
function: Open Path Gas Detector
rating: SIL2
overview: >-
  TGAES is capable of detecting most hydrocarbon gases and vapors including
  methane, propane, butane, propylene and others. No direct electrical
  connection between the two modules is required. In some applications, one
  TGAES detection system can provide protection equivalent to as many as eight
  point detectors.


  The TGAES transmitter module illuminates a direct linear path ending at the
  TGAES receiver module. As flammable hydrocarbon gases intersect the light beam
  between the two modules, certain IR wavelengths are absorbed by the gas, while
  other IR wavelengths are not. A pair of optical detectors and associated
  electronics located in the receiver module measures the absorption for both
  the active wavelength and reference wavelength. The ratio of absorption
  between the active and reference wavelengths determines the amount of gas
  intersecting the beam along its entire length. A microprocessor computes the
  gas concentration and converts the value into a 4-20mA signal and MODBUS
  register value.


  The TGAES Open Path Gas Detector is ideal for monitoring hydrocarbon leaks at
  fuel storage facilities. It is used for wide-area monitoring across potential
  leak sources, such as pumps and valves. When used in conjunction with point
  gas detectors such as the SGOES, the TGA Open Path Detector is a key element
  in a comprehensive early detection strategy
