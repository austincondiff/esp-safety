summary: >-
  ESP Safety’s Model IPES-IR/UV Flame Detector provides superior sensitivity for
  fires from oil and petrochemical products. It is also indicated for a wide
  range of other fire types including metal fires. 


  IPES-IR/UV’s advanced detection technology includes optical filters configured
  for maximum sensitivity to radiation produced by flame or fire and ensures
  rapid flame recognition and alarm signaling. Upon fire recognition within its
  90-degree field of view, the IPES-IR/UV signals a change in state from normal
  operation to fire in any OEM or proprietary alarm and response system.

function: Flame Detector
rating: SIL3
overview: >-
  In addition, via integrated ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) sensors, the
  IPES-IR/UV monitors in specific regions of both spectral ranges. In the
  infrared spectrum, the device is configured for sensitivity to wavelengths in
  the range of 4.2 to 4.6 microns, allowing optimal sensitivity to combustible
  gas fires while rejecting false signals from incandescent lamps, sunlight and
  hot objects. For ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the device is configured for
  sensitivity in the range of 180 to 250 nanometers, making the sensor “blind”
  to sunlight and radiation from heated objects but still able to “see” the UV
  radiation emitted by a flame. With these settings, the IPES-IR/UV detects and
  alarms for only those characteristic wavelength emissions from the UV and IR
  spectrum that indicate actual flame or fire.


  The combination of multiple sensors and wavelength range settings makes the
  IPES-IR/UV an excellent choice for elimination of false positive indicators
  caused by non-flame sources of radiation such as artificial lighting, direct
  and indirect sunlight, lightning, arc welding and metal grinding.


  While operating, the IPES-IR/UV generates detector-status information via:


  * A standard RS-485 communication channel under protocol Modbus RTU

  * 4-20 mA analog output

  * Relay outputs


  The IPES-IR/UV is constructed in an explosion-proof housing for use in
  hazardous (classified) locations and meets the industry certifications and
  requirements of Class I, Division 1, Group B, C & D, and T5.
