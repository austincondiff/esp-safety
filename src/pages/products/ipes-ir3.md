summary: >-
  The state-of-the-art multi-spectral infrared technology of ESP Safety’s Model
  IPES-IR3 Flame Detector affords the highest sensitivity in detecting flames
  from combustible vapors gases within a wide field of view. It is preferred
  where UV in other detectors may be a problem with false signal triggers.


  IPES-IR3’s advanced detection technology ensures rapid flame recognition and
  alarm signaling. In addition, IPES-IR3’s selective, multi-spectral technology
  virtually eliminates false alarms. It ignores false triggers from sources such
  as direct or indirect sunlight, arc welder flash, resistive heaters,
  fluorescent, halogen, and incandescent light.
model: IPES IR3
function: Flame Detector
rating: SIL3
overview: >-
  IPES-IR3 sends an alarm only when data from three different IR wavelengths
  agree that a flame or fire is present in the field of view. Upon confirmation
  of flame or fire, the IPES-IR3 transfers alarm signals to receiving control
  devices located in control and operations rooms and to fire alarms and
  burglar/fire alarm systems. While operating, the IPES-IR3 transmits
  detector-status information via:


  * 4-20 mA analog output

  * A standard RS-485 communication channel under protocol Modbus RTU

  * Relay outputs


  The IPES-IR3 Flame Detector is constructed with an explosion-proof housing for
  use in hazardous (classified) locations. It meets the certifications and
  requirements of Class I, Division 1, Group B, C & D, T4
