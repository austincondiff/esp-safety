summary: >-
  ESP Safety’s Vector is a state-of the-art field control unit that performs as
  an integrated control terminal and display for ESP Safety’s toxic and/or
  combustible gas detectors. The Vector can operate as a stand-alone display for
  a variety of ESP Safety’s detectors which can be remotely located up to 500
  feet away. A sensor head can also be attached directly to the display housing
  to produce a unified detector/display unit.
