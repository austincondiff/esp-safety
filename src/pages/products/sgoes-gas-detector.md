title: SGOES Gas Detector
subtitle: SIL2 Rated
slug: sgoes-gas-detector
category: combustible-gas-detectors
overview: >-
  ESP Safety’s Model SGOES Gas Detector measures the concentration of
  hydrocarbon gases present in the monitored environment. The SGOES is
  configured to report alarms when the gas concentrations in the environment
  reach the two independently programmable levels, expressed as a percentage of
  the lower explosive limit (LEL) in air. As determined by application
  requirements, the SGOES is factory calibrated with one of eight
  hydrocarbon-based gases (typically methane or propane). Conversion factors are
  used to correct for gases other than the factory calibration gas.


  The SGOES sensor detects and quantifies the presence of hydrocarbons by
  measuring their absorption of infrared light (IR). Because the device does not
  depend on the presence of oxygen in a mixture of gases, it can function
  effectively in environments where other sensor technologies cannot. Moreover,
  it is not sensitive to gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbonic acid, ammonia,
  and hydrogen sulfide, that may adversely affect other types of sensors. This
  makes the SGOES an excellent choice for environments where non-hydrocarbon
  gases are present and where monitoring of hydrocarbons like methane and
  propane is required.


  SGOES is FM-certified for use in potentially explosive gas/vapor environments
  in compliance with FM3615, CSA-C22.2 No 30 and EN 60079-1 standards for
  explosion proof protection. In addition, it meets ATEX and IECEX standard EN
  60079-29-1 and FM standard 6320 for performance of combustible gas detectors.


  The SGOES gas detector is typically used as an initiating device in fire and
  gas (F&G) detection and suppression systems as well as emergency shutdown
  (ESD) systems.


  The rugged SGOES design allows it to be used in harsh environments. It will
  operate from -76o F to +185o F (-60oC to +85oC) at relative humidity up to 95%

      The explosion-proof design of SGOES makes it ideal for use in hazardous
      environments such as: • Refineries • Tank farms • Pipelines • Loading
      racks. • Oil and gas facilities • Pumping stations


      SGOES is FM-certified for use in potentially explosive gas/vapor
      environments in compliance with FM3615 and CSA-C22.2 No 30 standards for
      explosion proof protection. In addition, it meets CSA standard E60079-1
      for flameproof protection, and ANSI/ISA standard 12.13.01-2000 for
      performance of combustible gas detectors.
